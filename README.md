# conclave

A bring-your-own-keys **multi-model council** — a CLI and Python library that
fans a prompt out to several foundation models concurrently (each via *your own*
API keys) and merges their answers into one consolidated response.

Built on conclave's own **provider highway** — an `httpx` async transport behind a
per-provider adapter registry, so there is **no LLM-SDK dependency** — plus `asyncio` for
concurrent fan-out, `rich` for output, and `pydantic` for config.

It is **library-first** (the CLI is a thin shell over the same `Council` you import),
returns **structured results** (per-model latency, token usage, and error capture), and is
**partial-failure resilient** — one provider erroring never aborts the run. Keys are
**bring-your-own**, referenced by environment-variable *name* only — never stored or
logged. It ships four modes: **synthesize** (merge answers into one), **raw** (no merge),
**debate** (multi-round, members revise after seeing peers' anonymized answers), and
**adversarial** (propose → refute → verdict); `vote` is on the roadmap. conclave is
intentionally lightweight — a small council primitive, not an agent framework.

## Install

```bash
pip install conclave-cli
```

> **Name split (read this once).** The PyPI **distribution** name is
> `conclave-cli` — the name `conclave` on PyPI is an *unrelated* project (a
> blockchain client, not this one). Everything else stays `conclave`: the CLI
> command you type is `conclave`, the package you import is `conclave`, and the
> repo is `conclave`. So:
> `pip install conclave-cli` → run `conclave ...` / `from conclave import Council`.

From a source checkout (for development), install it editable instead:

```bash
# from the repo root
pip install -e .
# or with dev/test extras
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Requires Python 3.11+.

## Bring your own keys

`conclave` never stores or hardcodes keys. It reads them from the environment
using each provider's standard variable name:

| Provider   | Friendly name | Default model id            | Env var(s)                       |
|------------|---------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| xAI        | `grok`        | `xai/grok-4.3`              | `XAI_API_KEY`                    |
| Google     | `gemini`      | `gemini/gemini-2.5-pro`     | `GEMINI_API_KEY` / `GOOGLE_API_KEY` |
| Anthropic  | `claude`      | `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`            |
| Perplexity | `perplexity`  | `perplexity/sonar-pro`      | `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`             |
| OpenAI     | `openai`      | `openai/gpt-4.1`            | `OPENAI_API_KEY`                 |
| Groq       | `groq`        | `groq/llama-3.3-70b-versatile` | `GROQ_API_KEY`                |
| DeepSeek   | `deepseek`    | `deepseek/deepseek-chat`    | `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`               |
| Mistral    | `mistral`     | `mistral/mistral-large-latest` | `MISTRAL_API_KEY`             |
| Together   | `together`    | `together/meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo` | `TOGETHER_API_KEY` |

Every first-class provider above is a **direct vendor key to a direct vendor
endpoint** — conclave never routes through an aggregator. Any other
OpenAI-compatible vendor (including aggregators/routers, which are deliberately
*not* first-class) remains usable config-only via an `endpoints:` entry.

Set whichever you have:

```bash
export XAI_API_KEY=...
export PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=...
```

Any requested provider whose key is absent is **skipped with a warning** — the
council runs with whoever is available. One provider erroring (network/auth)
never kills the run; you still get partial results plus a synthesis of the
survivors.

## Quickstart (CLI)

```bash
# Which providers have a key right now? (never prints key values)
conclave providers

# Fan out to a council and synthesize
conclave ask "Explain CRDTs in two sentences." \
  --council grok,gemini,claude,perplexity --mode synthesize

# Pick the synthesizer explicitly
conclave ask "Compare gRPC vs REST." -c grok,perplexity -s claude

# Raw answers only, no synthesis
conclave ask "Name three sorting algorithms." -c grok,perplexity --mode raw

# Debate: members revise over N rounds after seeing peers' anonymized answers
conclave ask "Is a service mesh worth it for 8 services?" \
  -c grok,gemini,claude --mode debate --rounds 3

# Debate with early-stop: stop before --rounds once answers stop changing
conclave ask "Is a service mesh worth it for 8 services?" \
  -c grok,gemini,claude --mode debate --rounds 5 --converge-threshold 0.95

# Adversarial: one model proposes, the rest refute, the synthesizer judges
conclave ask "Defend event sourcing for this ledger." \
  -c grok,gemini,perplexity --mode adversarial --proposer grok

# Machine-readable output (works for every mode; carries rounds/adversarial too)
conclave ask "..." -c grok,perplexity --mode debate --json
```

Mode flags at a glance: `--mode synthesize|raw|debate|adversarial`. `--rounds N`
(default 2) is the *maximum* round count for `debate`; `--converge-threshold FLOAT`
(or `--converge`/`--no-converge`) optionally stops a debate early once answers
stabilize round-over-round (off by default — `--rounds` runs in full). `--proposer
NAME` (default: first member) applies to `adversarial`. `--synthesizer/-s` overrides
the synthesizer *and* the adversarial judge.

`--council` accepts either a comma-separated list of friendly names or the name
of a council defined in your config (see below). The built-in `default` council
is all known providers.

Add `--stream` to render member (and synthesizer) tokens live as they arrive
(`synthesize`/`raw` modes only):

```bash
conclave ask "Explain CRDTs in two paragraphs." -c grok,gemini,claude --stream
```

Streaming and the non-streaming default produce the **same** final
`CouncilResult`; `--stream` only changes how output is rendered. It is ignored
with `--json` (which always emits the full structured payload), and on a cache
hit the cached text is rendered in one shot rather than as a fake token stream.

## Quickstart (library)

```python
from conclave import Council

council = Council(models=["grok", "perplexity"], synthesizer="claude")

# sync
result = council.ask_sync("What is the capital of France?")

# or async
# result = await council.ask("What is the capital of France?")

for answer in result.answers:
    print(answer.name, answer.latency_s, answer.error or answer.answer[:80])

print("SYNTHESIS:\n", result.synthesis)
```

### Streaming (synthesize/raw)

`Council.ask_stream` is an async generator that yields incremental `StreamEvent`s
as member (and synthesizer) tokens arrive, then a terminal `done` event carrying
the full `CouncilResult` — the same shape `ask()` returns, so downstream code is
unaffected:

```python
async for event in council.ask_stream("What is the capital of France?"):
    if event.type in ("member_delta", "synthesis_delta"):
        print(event.text, end="", flush=True)        # live token
    elif event.type == "done":
        result = event.result                          # full CouncilResult
```

Event types: `member_delta` / `member_done` (per member, interleaved),
`synthesis_delta` / `synthesis_done` (when synthesizing), and the final `done`.
A member that cannot stream, or any mid-stream failure, degrades gracefully —
partial text is preserved and the error lands on that member's `ModelAnswer`,
never raising (the same never-raises contract as `ask`). Streaming applies to
`synthesize`/`raw` only; `debate`/`adversarial` are not streamed.

### Debate and adversarial modes

```python
council = Council(models=["grok", "gemini", "claude"], synthesizer="claude")

# debate: multi-round, anonymized peers, partial-failure resilient
debate = council.debate_sync("Is P=NP likely false?", rounds=3)   # or: await council.debate(...)
for rnd in debate.rounds:
    print("round", rnd.round_number, [a.name for a in rnd.successful_answers])
print("FINAL:\n", debate.synthesis)

# debate with optional early-stop: stop before `rounds` once answers converge
quick = council.debate_sync("Is P=NP likely false?", rounds=5, converge_threshold=0.95)
print("ran", len(quick.rounds), "rounds; converged:", quick.converged, quick.convergence_score)

# adversarial: propose -> refute -> verdict
adv = council.adversarial_sync("Defend CRDTs for offline-first apps.", proposer="grok")
print("PROPOSAL by", adv.adversarial.proposer, "->", adv.adversarial.proposal.answer)
for crit in adv.adversarial.critiques:
    print("CRITIQUE", crit.name, ":", crit.error or crit.answer[:80])
print("VERDICT:\n", adv.adversarial.verdict)   # also mirrored to adv.synthesis
```

`CouncilResult` exposes `mode`, `answers` (per-model `ModelAnswer` with `model_id`,
`latency_s`, `usage`, `error`), `synthesis`, `synthesizer`, `skipped`, plus
`successful_answers` / `failed_answers` helpers. For `debate` it also carries
`rounds` (a list of `DebateRound`, each with per-member `answers`) plus
`converged`/`convergence_score` (set when an early-stop fired); for
`adversarial` it carries `adversarial` (an `AdversarialResult` with `proposer`,
`proposal`, `critiques`, `verdict`). For debate the final round is mirrored into
`answers` and the synthesis into `synthesis`; for adversarial the proposal +
critiques populate `answers` and the verdict mirrors into `synthesis` — so code
written against the v0.1 surface keeps working across every mode.

## Config (optional)

Create `~/.conclave/config.yml` to add models, define named councils, and set a
default synthesizer. It references providers by **name only** — never keys.

```yaml
models:
  grok: xai/grok-4.3
  claude: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6
councils:
  default: [grok, gemini, claude, perplexity]
  fast: [grok, perplexity]
synthesizer: claude
```

Then: `conclave ask "..." --council fast`.

## Result cache (optional, off by default)

Repeated or eval runs can be served from an on-disk cache instead of re-calling
the providers. It is **off by default** and **never persists API keys** — the
cache key is a SHA-256 over the normalized prompt, the ordered council members
(friendly name + resolved model id), the mode, the synthesizer/judge identity,
and the mode params (temperature, debate `rounds` + `converge_threshold`,
adversarial `proposer`). No key value or env-var name ever reaches the key or the
stored payload.

Enable it per run with `--cache` (or disable a config default with `--no-cache`):

```bash
conclave ask "..." --council fast --cache
```

or set a default in `~/.conclave/config.yml`:

```yaml
cache: true
```

A cache hit returns the prior `CouncilResult` with `cached: true` set and does
not touch the network. Entries live under `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/conclave` (else
`~/.cache/conclave`); a corrupt or unreadable entry is treated as a miss and
never crashes a run.

## Test

```bash
pytest
```

The suite mocks the httpx transport, so it needs no network and no API keys.

## Extending: custom OpenAI-compatible providers

conclave's provider layer is an adapter registry over a single `httpx` transport
(`resolve_adapter` in `src/conclave/adapters/`). The first-class providers are
adapters; adding a *new* provider family is one registration. Adding any
**OpenAI-compatible** endpoint (a local server, a gateway, another vendor's
`/chat/completions`, or an aggregator/router you choose to use) needs **no code** —
just an `endpoints:` entry in your config that names the base URL and the env-var
that holds its key:

```yaml
endpoints:
  myllm:
    base_url: https://my-gateway.internal/v1
    api_key_env: MYLLM_API_KEY
models:
  mymodel: myllm/some-model-id
```

The endpoint is referenced by **name only**; the key value is read from `MYLLM_API_KEY`
at call time and never stored in config or results.
