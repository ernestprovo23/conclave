"""Disagreement extraction + verdict synthesis engine (CAC-05).

Authoritative spec: ``03_DESIGN_DECISIONS_v1.1.md`` DD-1 (consensus method
``position_cluster_ratio_v1``) and DD-2 (verdict schema + verdict-absent rule),
plus ``00_SCOPE_PLAN.md`` §4 (the three honesty corrections).

This is a self-contained, council-agnostic engine. Given the prompt and the
council members' raw answers, it asks ONE synthesizer model to produce a
structured *judgment* (the clustering of stances, the conflicts, the votes), then
computes the consensus number **itself, deterministically**, from that clustering
— the model never emits the consensus score. CAC-06 wires :func:`extract_verdict`
into ``council.ask``; this module does not wire itself.

The auditability fix (DD-1, Scope Plan §4.1)
--------------------------------------------
Asking a model "how much do these answers agree?" is circular theatre. Instead
the model is asked only to CLUSTER each member's stance (the one irreducible
LLM-assisted step), and the consensus number is pure arithmetic over that
clustering via :mod:`conclave.agreement` (``|largest cluster| / |positioned
members|``). The number is therefore reproducible and auditable, never a value the
model could fabricate. The extraction schema (:func:`verdict_extraction_json_schema`)
carries no consensus field at all, so a model that smuggles one in is simply
ignored by the Pydantic validator. This module never imports difflib (the debate
``convergence_score`` text-similarity signal is a FORBIDDEN consensus measure,
DD-1) — agreement.py enforces the same rule with a guard test.

Structured-output strategy (native + prompt-level, belt-and-suspenders)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
CAC-06-PLUMB threaded an ``output_contract`` kwarg through
:func:`conclave.providers.call_model` to ``adapter.build_request``, so the engine
now requests structured output on TWO complementary layers:

1. **Native** — :func:`extract_verdict` builds one
   ``OutputContract(schema=verdict_extraction_json_schema(), schema_name=
   "VerdictExtraction", strict=True)`` and passes it to BOTH ``call_model`` calls
   (the initial extraction and the repair retry). Capable providers
   (OpenAI/Anthropic/Gemini) translate it to their provider-native surface
   (OpenAI ``response_format`` ``json_schema`` / Gemini ``responseSchema`` /
   Anthropic tool ``input_schema``) and ENFORCE the schema at decode time.
2. **Prompt-level (retained fallback)** — the same LCD JSON-Schema instruction and
   schema stay embedded in the system/user messages, and the JSON is still parsed
   out of ``ModelAnswer.answer`` (tolerating a ```json code fence) and validated by
   Pydantic (:class:`conclave.verdict.VerdictExtractionModel`) — no ``jsonschema``
   dependency. This is the belt-and-suspenders path for providers WITHOUT strict
   structured-output support: the adapter degrades gracefully (free prose) and
   warns, and the prompt-level parse/validate/repair below still produces a
   conforming verdict.

The native contract is ADDITIVE: it does not replace the parse/validate/repair
fallback, and the engine's failure behavior is unchanged (graceful
``verdict=None``).

Validate → repair-once → fallback (DD-2 verdict-absent rule)
------------------------------------------------------------
The extraction is parsed and validated. On a JSON or schema failure the engine
re-calls the model ONCE with the stringified errors appended, then validates
again. If it still fails (or the model returned an error / empty answer), the
verdict is absent (``verdict=None``) with a recorded reason — it NEVER raises. The
extractor's identity + prompt version is recorded as provenance on EVERY path
(success and all three absent paths).
