"""The Council: concurrent multi-model fan-out plus synthesis.

``Council`` is the primary importable entry point. It resolves friendly names to
provider-prefixed model ids, skips any member whose API key is absent, fans the prompt out
concurrently, collects partial results even when some members fail, and (in
synthesize mode) asks a synthesizer model to merge the answers into one.

The deliberation modes (``debate``, ``adversarial``) live in :mod:`conclave.modes`
and reuse this class's :meth:`Council.fan_out` primitive so the partial-failure
handling is written exactly once.

Synthesizer selection and degradation (the "council" value prop)
----------------------------------------------------------------

**Which model synthesizes.** Synthesis is performed by one *synthesizer* model,
separate from the council members (though a member may also be the synthesizer).
Selection precedence, highest first:

1. the ``synthesizer=`` argument to :class:`Council` (the CLI ``--synthesizer/-s``
   flag wires straight through to this);
2. the ``synthesizer:`` key in ``~/.conclave/config.yml``;
3. the built-in default :data:`conclave.registry.DEFAULT_SYNTHESIZER` (``"claude"``,
   i.e. ``anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6``).

The same model is the **judge** in ``adversarial`` mode and the final
consolidator in ``debate`` mode -- one selection drives all three.

**The fallback / degraded path is OBSERVABLE, never silent.** Synthesis can fail
to run for three reasons, and each one is signaled on the result rather than
silently swallowed:

* *No usable member answers* (every member errored/skipped) -- nothing to merge;
* *The synthesizer has no API key* in the environment;
* *The synthesizer call itself fails* (provider error/timeout).

In all three cases ``CouncilResult.synthesis`` stays ``None``, the member answers
are still returned intact, a warning is logged, and an actionable reason is set
on ``CouncilResult.synthesis_error`` (in ``adversarial`` mode the analogous
``AdversarialResult.verdict_error``, mirrored to ``synthesis_error``). A caller
can therefore always tell synthesis did **not** happen as expected by checking
``synthesis is None and synthesis_error is not None`` -- there is no path where
the council quietly returns concatenated/partial output dressed up as a synthesis.

**The synthesis prompt is a versioned constant.** The synthesize-mode system
prompt is :data:`_SYNTH_SYSTEM` (the debate/judge prompts live in
:mod:`conclave.prompts`); the prompt *set* carries the version tag
:data:`conclave.prompts.SYNTHESIS_PROMPT_VERSION`, stamped onto every
:class:`~conclave.models.CouncilResult` as ``prompt_version`` so a prompt change
is detectable downstream instead of being silently absorbed as model drift.

class Council:
    """A council of foundation models with an optional synthesizer.

    Args:
        models: Friendly names (or raw provider-prefixed model ids) of council members.
        synthesizer: Friendly name of the synthesizer model. If ``None``, the
            config default is used.
        config: Pre-loaded config; if ``None``, loaded from disk + defaults.
        temperature: Sampling temperature for member calls.
        timeout: Per-call timeout in seconds.
        cache: Opt-in result cache. ``None`` (default) defers to
            ``config.cache`` (off unless enabled in ``~/.conclave/config.yml``);
            ``True``/``False`` overrides it for this council. When enabled, an
            identical repeat run is served from the on-disk cache instead of
            re-calling the providers. The cache never persists API keys --
            see :mod:`conclave.cache`.
        extract_verdict: Whether to run the structured verdict-extraction step
            (CAC-05) after a synthesize-mode run. Defaults to ``True`` -- the
            auditable verdict (consensus score, conflicts, provider votes) is the
            council's product, so it is on by default. **Cost note:** verdict
            extraction makes a SECOND synthesizer call (one extra LLM round-trip
            per ``ask``, plus one more on the single repair retry) distinct from
            the prose ``synthesis`` call. Subsuming both into a single synthesizer
            call is a future optimization; for now this flag is the single opt-out.
            Set ``False`` to skip the verdict entirely (``CouncilResult.verdict``
            stays ``None`` and the manifest's verdict-provenance slots stay at
            their defaults). Verdict extraction never runs in ``raw`` mode
            (``synthesize=False``) regardless of this flag.
        allow_transport_debug_logging: Opt **out** of the transport-logging guard.
            Defaults to ``False``, which means the guard is **ON**: constructing a
            ``Council`` installs :func:`conclave.transport.guard_transport_logging`
            so httpx/httpcore ``DEBUG`` records -- the only band that emits request
            headers, including the live ``Authorization``/``x-api-key`` value -- are
            dropped before any handler formats them (key-leak audit, RANK 6). The
            guard is idempotent, so constructing many councils installs it once. The
            filter is scoped to the ``httpx``/``httpcore`` loggers only; it never
            touches the host application's root logger or any other logger.
            Set ``True`` to skip installation for the rare case where you genuinely
            need httpx/httpcore ``DEBUG`` output in a process that does not hold real
            keys; you remain responsible for that band then. Consumers using the
            provider functions directly (without a ``Council``) can still call
            :func:`conclave.guard_transport_logging` themselves.

    Example:
        >>> council = Council(models=["grok", "perplexity"], synthesizer="claude")
        >>> result = council.ask_sync("What is the capital of France?")
        >>> print(result.synthesis)

        ``member_done`` events; when ``synthesize`` is ``True`` the synthesizer's

        **Cache interaction.** When the result cache is enabled and an identical
        prior run is cached, there are no live provider tokens to stream: the

        This is the buffered (non-streaming) synthesize path; the streaming

        The SINGLE shared verdict-resolution path. Both the buffered
        ``ask``/:meth:`_ask_uncached` path (here) and the streaming path
        (CAC-06-STREAM) call this one method, so the rule "verdict object is
        canonical, top-level fields are mirrors" is written exactly once and the
        two paths cannot drift. It mutates ``result`` in place and returns
        ``None``.

        The verdict object (``result.verdict``) is the canonical adjudication; the
        convenience fields (``consensus_score``/``method``/``label``,
        ``conflicts``, ``provider_votes``, ``minority_reports``) are HOISTED
        mirrors of the same values for callers that don't want to reach through
        ``result.verdict``. They are populated only when a verdict is present;
        when it is absent they stay at their ``None``/empty defaults.

        Consensus is NEVER recomputed here: it is carried verbatim from
        :func:`conclave.verdict_synthesis.extract_verdict`, which computes it
        deterministically from the model's clustering (DD-1). This method only
        delegates and copies fields.

        **Opt-out & cost.** When ``self.extract_verdict_enabled`` is ``False`` this
        is a no-op and every verdict field is left at its default. When enabled it
        makes a SECOND synthesizer call (the extraction round-trip, plus one repair
        retry on a malformed response) distinct from the prose synthesis call --
        the documented cost of the default-on verdict.

        ``extract_verdict`` owns the N<2 gate (it returns ``verdict=None`` with the
        reason ``"fewer than 2 responding members"`` and makes NO LLM call in that
        case), so this method delegates unconditionally rather than duplicating the
        responder-counting logic; that keeps a single code path and lets the
        manifest carry the N<2 reason. ``extract_verdict`` never raises, and this
        method only assigns already-secret-free objects afterward, so no defensive
        try/except is needed.

        When ``result.manifest`` exists its verdict-provenance slots are populated
        (extractor identity + prompt version, absent reason, consensus method,
        verdict type) and the manifest's ``secret_safety`` stamp is RE-RUN over the
        final content: the stamp was first computed in :meth:`_build_manifest`
        before these fields existed, so re-stamping keeps the VERIFIED claim honest
        over the manifest a consumer actually receives. The new fields (a resolved
        model id, a prompt-version string, the ``verdict_type``/``consensus_method``
        literals) are provably key-free, so the stamp stays VERIFIED.
