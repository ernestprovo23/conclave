"""Shared async HTTP transport: the single network boundary for conclave.

Every provider call -- regardless of adapter -- sends its request through
:func:`post_json`. Concentrating all network I/O here gives us exactly one place
to pool connections, one place to normalize timeout/connection failures into a
single internal error type, and one stable patch seam for transport-level tests
(patch ``conclave.transport.post_json``).

The transport is intentionally provider-agnostic: it knows nothing about auth
headers, model ids, or response shapes. Adapters build the request and parse the
response; the transport just moves bytes and reports HTTP status.

# SECURITY-CRITICAL, OUT-OF-BAND OF redact(): httpx and httpcore have their own
# `logging` loggers. At DEBUG level httpcore logs the full request headers --
# which include ``Authorization: Bearer <key>`` and ``x-api-key: <key>`` -- to
# whatever handler the host application configured. conclave's ``redact()`` only
# scrubs the error/diagnostic strings *it* produces; it cannot reach inside the
# third-party transport loggers. So a consumer that turns on transport DEBUG
# logging (``logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)`` app-wide, or explicitly
# raising the httpx/httpcore loggers) would leak live keys to their own logs,
# entirely bypassing every redaction conclave performs.
#
# We cannot (and should not) globally silence another library's logging for the
# whole process -- that would be surprising and could hide legitimate debugging.
# Instead we expose an explicit, opt-in guard a security-conscious library
# consumer can call once at startup. It installs a filter that drops any
# httpx/httpcore log record at DEBUG severity (the only level that emits header
# content), while leaving INFO+ records untouched. See SECURITY.md "Threat
# model" for the documented trust boundary and accepted limitation.

    The streaming counterpart of :func:`post_json` and the single streaming
    network boundary for conclave (issue #7). It reuses the same pooled client
    and timeout plumbing, and -- like ``post_json`` -- knows nothing about auth
    headers or provider response shapes: it parses the SSE wire format and hands
    each event back to the adapter to interpret.

    SSE framing parsed here (the subset every supported vendor uses):

    * Events are separated by a blank line.
    * ``event: <name>`` sets the event name for the current event (Anthropic
      uses named events; OpenAI/Gemini do not, so ``event`` is ``""`` there).
    * ``data: <payload>`` lines are accumulated (multiple ``data:`` lines in one
      event are joined with ``\\n``, per the SSE spec).
    * Comment lines (starting ``:``) and other fields are ignored.

    A non-2xx status on the streaming response is surfaced as a
    :class:`TransportError` whose message includes the status and a bounded,
    decoded body snippet (the adapter wraps it as a ``ProviderError`` upstream).
    The body is read fully only on the error path; on success nothing is
    buffered beyond one line at a time.

    Args:
        url: Fully-qualified endpoint URL built by the adapter.
        headers: Request headers built by the adapter (may carry the API key).
        json_body: The request payload to serialize as JSON (already carrying
            the provider's stream-enabling flag).
        timeout: Per-call timeout in seconds (applied to the whole request).

    Yields:
        ``(event_name, data)`` pairs in arrival order. ``event_name`` is ``""``
        when the stream omits ``event:`` lines. ``data`` is the raw payload
        string (typically JSON, or the ``[DONE]`` sentinel for OpenAI-style
        streams); the adapter decodes it.

    Raises:
        TransportError: On any network-level failure (timeout, connection
