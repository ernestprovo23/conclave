"""Streaming orchestration for the synthesize/raw path (issue #7).

This module owns the council-level streaming logic so :mod:`conclave.council`
stays focused on the buffered modes. :func:`stream_ask` is the single
async-generator engine behind :meth:`conclave.council.Council.ask_stream`: it

* fans the prompt out to every available member **concurrently**, interleaving
  each member's incremental text into one flat :class:`conclave.models.StreamEvent`
  sequence (``member_delta`` / ``member_done``),
* optionally streams the synthesizer over the successful answers
  (``synthesis_delta`` / ``synthesis_done``), and
* emits a terminal ``done`` event carrying the fully-assembled
  :class:`conclave.models.CouncilResult` whose shape is **byte-for-byte
  identical** to the non-streaming :meth:`Council.ask` result -- so downstream
  consumers (and the cache) are unaffected.

The terminal ``done`` result also carries the auditable
:class:`conclave.manifest.ModelHarnessManifest` (CAC-04) and the structured
verdict (CAC-05/CAC-06) -- making the "byte-for-byte identical to non-streaming"
claim literally true rather than aspirational (CAC-06-STREAM). Both are produced
by reusing :meth:`Council._build_manifest` and the single shared
:meth:`Council._apply_verdict` helper, so the streaming and buffered paths cannot
drift: the verdict object stays canonical and the manifest's verdict-provenance
slots are populated exactly once, in one place. The assembly order mirrors
:meth:`Council._ask_uncached` exactly -- build the manifest after the answers are
reassembled, then (synthesize mode only) stream the synthesizer and apply the
verdict -- so manifest -> synthesize -> verdict holds on both paths.

The empty-members early return mirrors :meth:`Council._ask_uncached`'s memberless
return: it attaches a manifest (full skip list, no receipts, VERIFIED stamp) but
deliberately attaches **no verdict** -- a council with zero responders has nothing
to adjudicate, and ``_apply_verdict`` is never reached in the buffered path
either, so the streamed memberless ``done`` carries ``verdict=None`` for parity.

Streaming applies to the synthesize/raw path only; ``debate``/``adversarial``
are intentionally out of scope for this issue.

Interleaving is done with an :class:`asyncio.Queue`: each member runs as its own
task draining :func:`conclave.providers.call_model_stream` and pushing events
onto the queue, while the generator yields whatever arrives first. This gives
true concurrency (slow members do not block fast ones) with deterministic
final assembly (the final :class:`CouncilResult.answers` list is ordered by the
members list, not by completion order).

    Yields:
        ``member_delta`` / ``member_done`` events per member (interleaved),
        then ``synthesis_delta`` / ``synthesis_done`` when synthesis runs, then
        a terminal ``done`` event whose ``result`` is the full

        -- the structured verdict, identical to what :meth:`Council.ask` would

    Assembly mirrors :meth:`Council._ask_uncached` exactly so the two paths cannot

    * **Normal path.** After the answers are reassembled in members order the
      manifest is built (on BOTH raw and synthesize, exactly like the buffered
      path builds it before its ``if synthesize`` block). Then, in synthesize
      mode only, the synthesizer is streamed and -- after its stream completes --
      the shared :meth:`Council._apply_verdict` runs, populating
      ``result.verdict`` plus the manifest's verdict-provenance slots. Raw mode
      never extracts a verdict (no synthesizer call), again matching the buffered
      path. Final order: build manifest -> stream synthesis -> apply verdict ->
      emit ``done``.

    Never-raises, secret-safety, and partial-text-on-member-failure behavior are
    unchanged: :meth:`Council._apply_verdict` and :meth:`Council._build_manifest`
    never raise and only ever attach secret-free, VERIFIED-stamped content.
