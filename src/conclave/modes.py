"""Deliberation modes: multi-round debate and adversarial propose/refute/verdict.

Both modes are built on :meth:`conclave.council.Council.fan_out` (the single
concurrency + partial-failure primitive) and :meth:`Council.synthesize_blocks`
(the single synthesizer call path). Keeping the logic here keeps ``council.py``
focused on the v0.1 surface while the deliberation algorithms live on their own.
Prompt wording lives in :mod:`conclave.prompts`.

Design notes:

* **Anonymization (debate).** In rounds 2..N each member is shown its peers'
  prior-round answers relabeled as ``Model A/B/C`` by stable position, *not* by
  brand. This reduces brand-bias (a model deferring to or attacking another by
  name) while keeping the cross-pollination that makes debate useful. A member
  never sees its own answer relabeled -- it is told which letter is "you".
* **Drop-out (debate).** A member that errors in a round drops out of all
  subsequent rounds; the debate continues with the survivors. One model failing
  never aborts the run -- the partial-failure contract from v0.1 is preserved.
* **Adversarial roles.** The proposer answers first; every other available
  member is a critic explicitly prompted to refute; the synthesizer is the judge.
