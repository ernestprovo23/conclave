"""CAC-07 verdict edge-case sweep (items 3 + 4), end-to-end through ``Council.ask``.

Every test drives a real verdict (or a real verdict-absence) through
:meth:`conclave.council.Council.ask` offline via the dual-seam ``patch_call_model``
harness in ``conftest``. No network. The constants for the three absent reasons are
IMPORTED from :mod:`conclave.verdict_synthesis` (never hardcoded) so a wording change
there fails these tests loudly rather than silently passing on a stale literal.

Sweep items covered here (see the CAC-07 brief):

* **Item 3 — clustering/partial-failure edge cases.**
  - ``test_n1_responder_no_verdict_seam_call``: N=1 responding member -> verdict
    None, manifest reason ``_REASON_TOO_FEW``, and the verdict seam is NEVER called
    (the handler raises ``AssertionError`` if it sees a verdict call).
  - ``test_n2_tie_is_split``: N=2 with each member on a DIFFERENT position_label ->
    ``consensus_label == "split"`` and ``consensus_score == 0.5`` (a 1-of-2 tie).
  - ``test_partial_failure_verdict_over_responders_only``: >=2 succeed, 1 errors ->
    consensus computed over responders only; the errored member is recorded in the
    manifest's ``redacted_errors`` + as a receipt carrying ``error`` (NOT in
    ``providers_skipped`` — that slot is for missing-key skips only); verdict present.
  - ``test_all_members_fail_graceful``: every member errors -> no verdict, no crash,
    ``synthesis is None``, ``synthesis_error`` set, manifest attached + VERIFIED.

* **Item 4 — verdict-absent paths end-to-end.**
  - ``test_extraction_fails_both_calls``: non-JSON on the initial call AND the repair
    retry -> verdict None, reason ``_REASON_EXTRACTION_FAILED``, synthesis/answers
    survive.
  - ``test_repair_success_bad_then_good``: bad JSON the FIRST time the verdict seam
    is hit, GOOD extraction JSON the SECOND time (closure-counted) -> verdict
    PRESENT, proving the one-repair path actually repairs (a second seam call is
    made — confirmed in ``verdict_synthesis.extract_verdict`` step 3).
  - (the open-ended absent path is covered in ``test_integration_verdict.py`` via
    the parity test; ``test_council_verdict.py`` also covers it directly.)
