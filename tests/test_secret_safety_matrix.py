"""CAC-07 headline secret-safety matrix (sweep item 1): the canary leaks nowhere.

The load-bearing security sweep. A synthetic, key-shaped canary (the keyleak-audit
``PLANTED`` token — gitleaks-allowlisted, contains ``FAKE``) is planted as the LIVE
value of every provider key the council uses, then THREE flows are driven:

* **1a — buffered ``Council.ask(synthesize=True)`` with a real verdict** (offline
  dual-seam harness): no member ever hits the network, so the success path proves
  the canary value is absent from every serialized surface even when redaction was
  never exercised.
* **1b — streamed ``ask_stream(synthesize=True)``** (member stream seam fake +
  ``patch_call_model`` verdict seam): every ``StreamEvent`` AND the terminal
  ``done`` result are scanned.
* **1c — forced provider-error run on the REAL ``call_model`` highway** (NOT the
  offline seam): ``conclave.transport.post_json`` is mocked to return a 401 whose
  body ECHOES the canary (the v1.0 leak class). This is the STRONG negative control
  — a non-redacting code path WOULD surface the canary here. Includes a streaming
  variant via the copied ``mock_stream_client`` httpx ``MockTransport`` fixture.

Each flow asserts BOTH distinct invariants the brief separates:
  (a) the literal canary VALUE (the full ``PLANTED`` string) appears in NONE of the
      enumerated serialized surfaces; AND
  (b) ``manifest.secret_safety == SECRET_SAFETY_VERIFIED`` and
      ``scan_for_secret_material(manifest) is True`` (structurally clean — no
      ``sk-``/``bearer``/``authorization``/``api_key``/``x-api-key`` anywhere).

Note the ``sk-`` overlap: ``PLANTED`` starts with ``sk-``, which is also one of the
manifest's forbidden substrings, so (b) can only pass if redaction genuinely worked
and the canary never reached the manifest.

All tests offline. The ``mock_stream_client`` fixture is reproduced from
``tests/test_keyleak_audit.py`` (test-local there; copied, not imported).
