"""CAC-07 integration sweep: auditability, parity, and structured-output degradation.

A hardening cross-cut over the default-on verdict pipeline. Every test drives a
REAL verdict end-to-end through :meth:`conclave.council.Council.ask` (and, for the
parity item, also through ``ask_stream``) offline via the dual-seam harness in
``conftest`` (``patch_call_model`` patches BOTH the council member seam and the
verdict seam) plus the member stream seam fake copied from
``tests/test_streaming_verdict.py``. No network, ever.

Sweep items covered here (see the CAC-07 brief):

* **Item 2 — auditability invariant.** The consensus number on the result is the
  deterministic ``position_cluster_ratio_v1`` arithmetic over the model's
  clustering (:mod:`conclave.agreement`), NEVER a number the extractor model
  emitted. A BOGUS top-level ``consensus_score`` smuggled into the extraction JSON
  is dropped by :class:`conclave.verdict.VerdictExtractionModel` (Pydantic
  ``extra="ignore"``) and never reaches the verdict — proven for a unanimous
  clustering (computed 1.0 beats smuggled 0.123) AND a split clustering (computed
  2/3 beats smuggled 1.0).
* **Item 5 — streaming<->non-streaming parity (NEW scenarios).** A SPLIT (2 vs 1)
  verdict and a verdict-ABSENT (open-ended) run each produce a field-by-field
  identical verdict + manifest verdict-provenance through ``ask`` and
  ``ask_stream``. These are scenarios the existing ``test_streaming_verdict.py``
  (which only covers the unanimous case) does not exercise.
* **Item 6 — structured-output degradation.** The extractor's JSON wrapped in a
  ```` ```json ... ``` ```` markdown code fence still yields a valid verdict via the
  ``_strip_code_fence`` path (the plain-text case is the default elsewhere).

The test-local helpers (``_all_keys``, ``_config``, ``_is_verdict_call``,
``_extraction_json``, ``_patch_member_stream``) are copied VERBATIM from
``tests/test_council_verdict.py`` / ``tests/test_streaming_verdict.py`` because
those helpers are per-file, not shared. Mock data lives only in tests.
